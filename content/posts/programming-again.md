With the holiday weekend last weekend, I was finally able to program some on
Bibliophilium which as you may recall is the library managing site that I'm
working on.

I spent most of the weekend getting logins working and getting the hosting to
work. I feel so behind because I don't work with heroku [heroku.com] on a
regular basis.

There is quite literally nothing to look at on the staging site
[http://bibliophilium-staging.herokuapp.com] but rails is chugging away in the
background.
