I'm blogging at you this week from Louisville, KY where I'm in town for the
wedding of my oldest and closest friend.

I also started my next class for my Computer Science degree. It's a Data
Structures and Algorithms class. This type of class has been talked up all over
the Internet as the most important class in a computer science degree. I'll
update you all my thoughts on the class as it goes.
