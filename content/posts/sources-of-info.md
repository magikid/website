I've learned a lot about programming over the years. I started learning
programming with HTML which is the language of the web. Through the years, I
have found a bunch of great resources for learning. This post is dedicated to my
current sources of information. 

My favorite blog that I read these days is called Giant Robots Smashing into
Other Giant Robots [https://robots.thoughtbot.com/]. It's written by a company
of programmers. They work Monday thru Thursday and help others on Friday.
Writing the blog is one way they help. The provide insight into their current
best practices as well as new techniques they are developing. Just this week, I
have read several of their blog posts relating to testing Ruby on Rails
applications. These guys rock!

The next blog up that I read regularly is called RubyFlow
[http://www.rubyflow.com/]. It is a firehose of information. It collects blog
posts about Ruby and publishes links to them. It's how I stay up-to-date on the
Ruby world.

The final blog that I'm going to mention is called Coding Horror
[http://blog.codinghorror.com/]. It's sometimes related to programming and
sometimes it's about general software development culture. I enjoy the style of
it and I also read it because Jeff Atwood is a mammoth figure in the development
world. He co-created the website Stack Overflow.

Wrapping this up, I'm going to mention a podcast that I listen to. It's called
the Ruby On Rails podcast [http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails] (super original). This is
a relatively long podcast that publishes about bi-weekly. I enjoy it because
they will interview developers of major projects. Like for example in this last
episode, he interviewed a developer working.
