Life Is getting busy for me. In about two weeks my wife, Hilary, and I will be
moving. In addition to that, I have an astronomy class that just finished and a
discrete math class that starts on Monday. I also have a busy schedule when I'm
at work.

This isn't the first time that I have found the pace of life picking up. I have
found that when I get stressed out about having a lot on my plate, the best
thing I can do is control what I can and try to not let the rest bother me. That
means that I have been making schedules and lists for the upcoming move and
taking things in stride when the don't work out like I want. For example, a
townhouse that we were interested was pulled off the market the day that we were
going to view it. Frustrating.

Two points that I always keep on my schedule though are reading and programming.
Sometimes they overlap [https://pinboard.in/u:magikid/t:feedly/] when I get
especially busy. Currently, I'm reading Murder at the Vicarage
[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/913989470] by Agatha Christie. It's a
little outside my usual genre of hard sci-fi/space opera but I'm enjoying it so
far. It's going to be a quick read.

As for programming, I'm still working on my bibliophilium site but slowly. I
want to start correctly so that I don't get a few months in and wish I had done
things differently. That involves researching implementations. Also, moving kind
of eats into my programming time.
