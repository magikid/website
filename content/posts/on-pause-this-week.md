I was planning on writing another post about creating an API but I'm exhausted.
This weekend Hilary and I moved our worldly possesions into some U-Haul U-Boxes
[http://www.uhaul.com/UBox/]. We finished moving out of our apartment today and
as of 2pm, we're officially homeless for a week until our new townhome is
available.

With all this flurry of activity, I just don't have it in me to write a blog
post about how to create an API for a website using the Grape gem. Check back
next week for a new article!
