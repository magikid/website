At work, I hang out in a chat room with other programmers. We mainly tell bad
jokes all day but I was tipped off to a really fun programming exercise game.
It's called Elevator Saga [http://play.elevatorsaga.com/].



The point of the game is to program a set of elevators to efficiently go from
floor to floor, picking up and dropping off passengers. And if you're wondering
how exactly you program an elevator, the designers have created an API
[http://play.elevatorsaga.com/documentation.html] for controlling the elevators

There are different objectives for different levels. Sometimes you need to move
X amount of passengers in Y amount of time. On other levels, your elevator can
only make Z moves. I spent an evening tinkering around on it. Even though I
don't know a ton of javascript, it was easy enough to pick up on. Give it a try!

Here's the code that I have which I liberally borrowed:
