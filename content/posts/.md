Tailscale is the easiest VPN I've ever used.  It was a breeze to setup initially and simple to install on all my hosts.  It works so well that it runs my entire homelab network.

An incoming request to https://christopherjones.us first hits a DigitalOcean Droplet.  This instance acts like a load balancer.  Its only purpose is to run nginx and load balance back to my lab.  Once a request comes into it, the request is proxied over Tailscale to my home network to whichever server it happens to be running on.  This is how I expose the servers running in my home network without having to poke holes in my home's firewall.
