> My own prediction is that TDD is the deciding factor. You don't need static type
checking if you have 100% unit test coverage. And, as we have repeatedly seen,
unit test coverage close to 100% can, and is, being achieved. What's more, the
benefits of that achievement are enormous.
Therefore, I predict, that as TDD becomes ever more accepted as a necessary
professional discipline, dynamic languages will become the preferred languages.
