For those who missed it, I decided to try following Benjamin Franklin's schedule
[http://blog.christopherjones.us/2015/09/01/ben-franklin-schedule/].

I think I picked a poor week to try this schedule change. Monday and Tuesday
were successful. I felt super productive. I woke up at 5am both days. I had time
to workout, check email, and eat breakfast before I started getting ready for
work.

Then came Wednesday. I had to be at an exercise at 7am on the dot so I didn't
have much time to get relax before getting ready. By the time I made it home in
the evening, I was quite tired and not feeling well at all. I came down with a
bad cold. I barely made it through work on Thursday after waking up at 6am
instead of 5am. I'm hoping to be feeling better this week so that I can try
again.
