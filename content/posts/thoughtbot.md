This weeks article is going to be about a blog that I consider to be a mentor.
That blog is Giant Robots Smashing Into Other Giant Robots
[https://robots.thoughtbot.com]. It is written by different people at the
company thoughtbot [https://thoughtbot.com/].



I really like this blog. Out of all of the resources that I have on the internet
for programming, I turn to it first. They develop mainly in Ruby on Rails which
is what I mainly use too. They also share pretty much every step of their
development process.

They write books documenting their best practices as well as new techniques. I
am actually reading through their new employee handbook because I find it
interesting to see how they develop new software. Obviously since I program as a
team of one, a lot of their team processes don't make sense for me. But I still
read them because I think they will come in handy when I start looking for a job
as a programmer.

They don't just write books and blogs though. They also write and release code
on github [https://github.com/thoughtbot]. High quality code that is used by a
lot of people. I actually started using one of their projects before I realized
it was a project of theirs. I started using factory girl
[https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails] in my tests because I find it
easier to use in rails than fixtures.

So tl;dr for this post is that Thoughtbot rocks!
