I was listening to a new (for me) podcast [http://bikeshed.fm/45] about
development. The people hosting it are famous rails
[https://github.com/rails/rails] developers but they also talk about other
topics.

One of the developers has a side project where he is creating an ORM for this
new language Rust [https://www.rust-lang.org/]. An ORM is a layer between the
database and a language that abstracts away a lot of the details of the
database. It usually makes it a lot easier to deal with a database.

I decided to cut my teeth on Rust by trying to contributing to his project.

We'll see how it goes.
