The other morning, I was looking over a recent Jenkins build at work and
realized that I had no idea why it took 5 minutes to build the container.  When
using Assetic
[https://symfony.com/doc/2.8/frontend/assetic/asset_management.html] to build
our assets, I can add a --profile flag and get line-by-line timings for each
asset generated.  I wanted that for docker build.

After a little research, I discovered the answer in a StackOverflow post
[https://stackoverflow.com/a/51760937/1695439].  The ts program which is part of
the moreutils package accepts data from a pipe and echos a timestamp plus the
original text.

I tried running it but got a "command not found" error in my terminal.  To
install the ts program, you need to install the moreutils package.  On my mac, I
ran brew install moreutils.  If you're not on mac, you should be able to install
it through your OS's package manager.

Now that I had the ts program installed, I was finally able to time my build.
